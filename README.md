## 🎯 How It Works

### C-Suite Orchestrated Approach

Launchonomy implements a unique **C-Suite orchestrated** approach where:

1. **Strategic Planning**: C-Suite agents (CEO, CRO, CTO, CFO) make high-level strategic decisions
2. **Workflow Execution**: Specialized workflow agents execute operational tasks
3. **Strategic Review**: C-Suite agents review results and adjust strategy
4. **Continuous Iteration**: The cycle repeats until mission objectives are achieved

### Workflow Agent Sequence

The system executes workflow agents in a logical business sequence:

1. **ScanAgent** - Identifies market opportunities
2. **DeployAgent** - Builds and deploys products/services  
3. **CampaignAgent** - Creates and manages marketing campaigns
4. **AnalyticsAgent** - Tracks performance and generates insights
5. **FinanceAgent** - Manages financial operations and compliance
6. **GrowthAgent** - Optimizes for growth and scaling

### Mission-Scoped RAG Memory System

Launchonomy features an advanced **mission-scoped RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) memory system** powered by ChromaDB that enables agents to learn from past experiences and make context-aware decisions:

#### 🧠 **Memory Architecture**
- **Per-Mission Vector Store**: Each mission gets its own ChromaDB collection stored in `~/.chromadb_launchonomy/mission_<mission_id>`
- **Persistent Memory**: Memories persist across mission cycles and system restarts
- **Semantic Search**: Agents can query memories using natural language to find relevant past experiences
- **Structured Metadata**: Memories are tagged with mission ID, agent name, workflow step, timestamp, and category

#### 🔍 **Memory Types**
- **Workflow Events**: Key outcomes from each workflow step (scan results, deployment details, campaign performance)
- **Strategic Insights**: Learnings and observations from agents during execution
- **Decision Records**: Important decisions made by agents with their reasoning
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative results and KPIs from each cycle
- **Success Patterns**: Successful strategies and approaches for future replication
- **Error Learning**: Failed attempts and their causes for future avoidance

#### 🤖 **RetrievalAgent**
A specialized agent that provides memory access to all other agents:
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Query memories using natural language descriptions
- **Filtered Search**: Search by specific workflow steps, time periods, or categories
- **Context Integration**: Automatically enriches agent prompts with relevant memories
- **Memory Statistics**: Provides insights into memory store usage and growth

#### 💡 **Context-Aware Decision Making**
Every agent automatically receives relevant memories before making decisions:
```
Relevant Mission Memory:
- [scan - 2024-01-15] Previous scan found AI newsletter services have 85% higher conversion rates
- [deploy - 2024-01-14] MVP deployment using Next.js reduced time-to-market by 40%
- [campaign - 2024-01-13] Email campaigns outperformed social media by 3x in customer acquisition
```

#### 🔧 **Memory Integration**
- **Automatic Logging**: All workflow steps automatically log their results to memory
- **Smart Retrieval**: Agents query memories based on their current task context
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Insights from one agent become available to all others
- **Continuous Improvement**: Each mission builds upon learnings from previous missions

### Mission Logging

Every mission is comprehensively logged with:
- Strategic decisions from C-Suite agents
- Workflow agent execution results
- Financial tracking and guardrails
- Error handling and recovery
- Token usage and costs
- **Memory interactions and learnings**

Mission logs are saved as JSON files with parameterized names:
```
mission_logs/mission_20250526_005050_test_reorganized_codebase.json
```

### AutoGen Integration Architecture

Launchonomy uses a strategic hybrid approach with Microsoft AutoGen v0.4:

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- ✅ **Use AutoGen for Infrastructure** - Model clients, message handling, base agents
- ✅ **Build Custom for Business Logic** - C-Suite orchestration, mission management, workflows  
- ✅ **Maintain Clear Separation** - Technical foundation vs. business intelligence
- ✅ **Future-Proof Design** - Can adopt new AutoGen features selectively

This hybrid approach gives us the technical robustness of AutoGen with the business intelligence of custom domain-specific logic.

```

### Mission Log Analysis

Use the mission log navigator to analyze completed missions:

```bash
python launchonomy/utils/mission_log_navigator.py
```

## 🧪 Development

### Project Structure

The codebase follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **Core**: Main orchestration logic and management systems
- **Agents**: All agent implementations with clear inheritance hierarchy
- **Registry**: Dynamic agent discovery and lifecycle management
- **Utils**: Shared utilities for logging, consensus, etc.
- **Templates**: Agent prompts and configuration templates

### Adding New Agents

1. Create agent class inheriting from `BaseWorkflowAgent`
2. Implement required methods (`execute`, `get_capabilities`, etc.)
3. Add to appropriate module (`workflow/`, `csuite/`, etc.)
4. Register in the agent registry

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

3. Set environment variable: `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`
4. Redeploy to activate tracking

#### **Tool Integration**
The system can also use analytics tools to automatically set up tracking:

```python
# Analytics tool integration
analytics_result = await analytics_tool.execute({
    "action": "setup_analytics",

    "product_name": "Your MVP"
})
```
