1. Core Objective & Constraints
Objective: Acquire the first paying customer ASAP, then drive exponential, profitable growth.

Constraints:

Initial budget: $500

Profit guardrail: total costs ≦ 20% of revenue

2. Agent & Tool Registry
Agents: Research, Build, Marketing, Content, Product, Analytics, Finance.

Tool Catalog: A living registry of function endpoints (e.g. n8n webhooks, internal utilities) that agents may call.

Agents may propose, create, edit, or remove both agents and tools by unanimous consensus—no developer hand-coding needed.

3. Autonomous Consensus Lifecycle
Trigger: An agent “sees” a need (new capability, tool fix, agent update).

Proposal: Draft change spec (add/edit/remove).

Discussion: All agents comment (“👍/👎 + suggestions”).

Unanimous Vote:

Accept: COA updates Agent & Tool registries automatically.

Reject: Owner refines spec until consensus.

No human approval step—agents govern themselves.

4. Continuous Launch & Growth Loop

Key Features:

Self-governed: Agents execute, monitor, govern, and evolve without humans.

Minimal human alerts: only on actual payment processing errors or credit-card failures.

Automated tool creation: if a needed webhook or function is missing, agents draft & onboard it via consensus.

Exponential growth: after first sale, agents run product/marketing experiments, measure LTV/CAC and viral loops, then auto-scale winning tactics.

5. Human-In-The-Loop (Only if…)
A payment gateway outage or infrastructure failure.

Regulatory/compliance approval for a new market spend.
