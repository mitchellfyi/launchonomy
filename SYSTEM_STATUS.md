# Launchonomy System Status

## 🎉 Current Implementation Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The Launchonomy system is now fully operational with complete AutoProvisionAgent integration and C-Suite bootstrap functionality. **Trivial gaps never reach the human** - they are automatically handled through consensus-based auto-provisioning. The system implements the complete primer specification with a founding C-Suite team ready for immediate collaboration.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### 1. OrchestrationAgent (`orchestrator/orchestrator_agent.py`)
- **Main orchestrator** that manages specialist AI agents to achieve business missions
- **C-Suite Bootstrap** - Automatically creates founding team of 9 C-Suite agents as per primer:
  - CEO-Agent, CRO-Agent, CTO-Agent, CPO-Agent, CMO-Agent, CDO-Agent, CCO-Agent, CFO-Agent, CCSO-Agent
  - Each agent seeded with full mission context and specialized expertise
  - Implements the "Auto-Bootstrap Founding Team" specification from the primer
- **Decision cycle execution** with specialist selection, decision loops, execution, and review
- **Dynamic agent creation** based on mission requirements
- **Cost tracking** for all LLM interactions
- **Comprehensive logging** and retrospective analysis
- **Registry integration** for tools and agents
- **AutoProvisionAgent integration** for dynamic tool/agent provisioning

### 2. AutoProvisionAgent (`orchestrator/agents/auto_provision_agent.py`)
- **Automatic detection** of missing tools/agents during execution
- **Triviality assessment** to determine if items can be auto-provisioned
- **Stub generation** for tools (webhook endpoints) and agents
- **Consensus voting** system for proposal approval
- **Registry integration** to persist new tools/agents
- **Async operation** for seamless integration with orchestrator

### 3. Registry System (`orchestrator/registry.py` + `registry.json`)
- **JSON-backed storage** for agents and tools
- **Dynamic loading/saving** of registry data
- **Tool and agent specifications** with endpoints, schemas, etc.
- **Proposal application** system for auto-provisioning
- **Tool name listing** for discovery and lookup

### 4. Consensus System (`orchestrator/consensus.py`)
- **Centralized voting mechanism** with 100% unanimous approval requirement
- **Registry-based agent discovery** for voting participants
- **Strict validation** ensures only trivial proposals pass through
- **Comprehensive logging** of all voting decisions and rationale
- **Error handling** treats missing vote_on methods as "no" votes

### 5. CLI Interface (`orchestrator/cli.py`)
- **Rich terminal UI** with live updates, spinners, and panels
- **Mission monitoring** with agent status and activity logs
- **C-Suite bootstrap integration** during mission initialization
- **User interaction** for accept/reject decisions
- **Auto-acceptance** for successful cycles without human tasks
- **Debug mode** support

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Complete AutoProvisionAgent Integration
- **Full Loop Integration**: AutoProvisionAgent is wired into all key orchestrator decision points:
  - Tool requests during execution (`_execute_with_guardrails`)
  - Agent selection when no suitable specialist exists (`_select_or_create_specialist`)
  - Human intervention interception (converts human tasks to auto-provisioning requests)
  - Registry tool lookups (`_get_tool_from_registry`)
- **Enhanced Triviality Detection**: Recognizes 17+ common business tool patterns:
  - `spreadsheet`, `calendar`, `email`, `file`, `document`, `storage`
  - `crm`, `analytics`, `payment`, `webhook`, `api`, `database`
  - `social`, `marketing`, `automation`, `integration`, `notification`
- **Consensus Voting**: All agents vote on proposals before implementation
- **Stub Generation**: Creates comprehensive tool specifications with:
  - Webhook endpoints (n8n-compatible)
  - Request/response schemas
  - Authentication placeholders
  - Metadata and descriptions

### ✅ C-Suite Founding Team Bootstrap
- **Automatic Initialization**: Creates all 9 C-Suite agents on startup
- **Primer Compliance**: Fully implements the "Auto-Bootstrap Founding Team" specification
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has distinct persona, expertise, and responsibilities
- **Mission Context**: All agents receive full mission context in system prompts
- **Registry Integration**: C-Suite agents are properly registered and discoverable
- **Idempotent Operation**: Safe to call bootstrap multiple times

### ✅ Dynamic Tool Registry
- **Runtime Tool Addition**: Tools can be added during mission execution
- **Persistent Storage**: Registry is saved to `orchestrator/registry.json`
- **Tool Lookup Integration**: `_execute_with_guardrails` checks registry for available tools
- **Endpoint Management**: Tools include endpoint details for actual integration
- **Tool Discovery**: Registry provides tool name listing for orchestrator

### ✅ Centralized Consensus System
- **100% Unanimous Approval**: Strict requirement ensures nothing slips through
- **Registry-Based Voting**: Automatically discovers all agents for voting
- **Centralized Logic**: Single `consensus.py` module handles all voting
- **Error-Safe Defaults**: Missing vote_on methods default to "no" votes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed vote tracking and decision rationale

### ✅ Enhanced Execution Pipeline
- **Tool-Aware Execution**: Execution prompts include available tool information
- **Context-Sensitive Tool Lookup**: Tools are looked up based on recommendation content
- **Cost Tracking**: Tool lookup costs are included in total execution costs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of auto-provisioning failures
- **Human Task Interception**: Converts human intervention requirements to auto-provisioning
